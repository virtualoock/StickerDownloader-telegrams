Token and Bot Initialization:

The Telegram bot token is set at the beginning of the script.
An Updater instance is created, which will handle updates from Telegram.
Start Command (/start):

The bot responds to the "/start" command by sending a welcome message to the user.
Download Sticker Function (download_sticker):

When a user sends a sticker, the download_sticker function is triggered.
The sticker object is obtained from the message.
The file_id and file_path are used to construct the URL of the sticker file on the Telegram server.
Sticker Download:

A GET request is made to the Telegram server to download the sticker file.
If the request is successful (status code 200), the script saves the sticker file with the format {file_id}.webp.
The user is notified of the success or failure of the download.
Telegram Bot Setup and Polling:

The script sets up the Telegram bot by adding handlers for the "/start" command and messages containing stickers.
The bot starts polling for updates, allowing it to respond to commands and messages on Telegram.
Please note that this script is a basic example, and handling animated stickers (APNG) would require a different approach. Additionally, consider the legal and ethical implications of downloading and using stickers from Telegram, and always respect intellectual property rights.
